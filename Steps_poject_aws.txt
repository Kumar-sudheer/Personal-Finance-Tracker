Here is my RDS database.  
  
Step 5: Created two new Lambda functions. Configure the functions’ execution role to allow it to access the RDS instance. Attach the necessary IAM policies.  
 Step 6: Create a new REST API then create resources and methods to handle different operations and integrate these methods with the corresponding Lambda functions. 
 
 
Step 7: Deploy your API in API Gateway then I have use tools like Postman or CURL to send HTTP requests to your API endpoints to ensure everything works correctly. 
Step 8: Ensure your RDS instance is not publicly accessible now use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection then implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms in your API.
